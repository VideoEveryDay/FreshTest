PROBLEMS

- rooms list doesn’t update in realtime

- if you go to a chat room before selecting a room, you get something weird with delete options and ‘loading chats’

- chats do not update in real time

- chats only refresh on <strong>interaction</strong>

- you can add multiple chats with the same person (‘hasChatsWith’ does nothing)

- Move input item and change height to 60px

- Notify other user when chat has been deleted
